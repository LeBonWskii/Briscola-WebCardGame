## Getting Started ‚öô

### Prerequisites
- **XAMPP**: A local development environment for PHP and MySQL.
- A web browser to access the game (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install and Configure XAMPP**  
   - Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) on your system.  
   - Start the Apache and MySQL services using the XAMPP control panel.  

2. **Set Up the Database**  
   - Open **phpMyAdmin** by navigating to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your browser.  
   - Create a new database called `BriscolaDB`.  
   - Import the database schema:  
     - Click on the `BriscolaDB` database in phpMyAdmin.  
     - Select the **Import** tab and upload the SQL file located [here](https://github.com/LeBonWskii/Briscola-WebCardGame/blob/main/sql/BriscolaDB.sql).  
     - Execute the import.

3. **Update the Database Connection**  
   - Locate the `connection.php` file [here](https://github.com/LeBonWskii/Briscola-WebCardGame/blob/main/php/connection.php).  
   - Ensure the database connection credentials match your MySQL setup. Example:
     ```php
     <?php
      DEFINE('DB_HOST', 'mysql:host=localhost:3306;dbname=BriscolaDB;charset=utf8');
      DEFINE('DB_USER', 'root');
      DEFINE('DB_PASSWORD', 'YourPassword');
     ?>
     ```

4. **Move the Project to the XAMPP Directory**

5. **Run the Application**  
   - Open your browser and type `http://localhost/` in the address bar.  
   - Click on the project folder name to start the game.

6. **Enjoy the Game** üéÆ
